[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddynamixel_h54.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "dynamixel_h54", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "dynamixel_h54"
  with any of the following names:

    dynamixel_h54Config.cmake
    dynamixel_h54-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "dynamixel_h54" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "dynamixel_h54_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "dynamixel_h54" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
